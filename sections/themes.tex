\section{Themes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sticking to strict constitutional norms versus deviations for the 
    sake of exigencies or emergencies---e.g., the Philadelphia Convention's 
    narrow mandate to revise the Articles of Confederation versus the 
    perceived need to draft a new constitution.\footnote{Cf. Casebook p. 21.}
    \item Were Hamilton and Iredells fears about the Bill of Rights---that 
    enumerating limitations on the federal government's powers ``would furnish 
    to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that 
    power''---vindicated?\footnote{Casebook pp. 25--26.}
    \item \textbf{Constitutionalism}: why does a court have the power to stop 
    ordinary democracy?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There have been only two cases where constitutional amendments 
        overruled Supreme Court decisions: Fourteenth (\emph{Dred Scott v. 
        Sandford}) and Twenty-Sixth (\emph{Oregon v. Mitchell}) Amendments.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Key areas:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Constitutionalism.
        \item Federalism.
        \item Liberty.
        \item Equality.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item How does popular legitimacy check government power?
\end{enumerate}
