\section{Themes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sticking to strict constitutional norms versus deviations for the 
    sake of exigencies or emergencies---e.g., the Philadelphia Convention's 
    narrow mandate to revise the Articles of Confederation versus the 
    perceived need to draft a new constitution.\footnote{Cf. Casebook p. 21.}
    \item Were Hamilton and Iredells fears about the Bill of Rights---that 
    enumerating limitations on the federal government's powers ``would furnish 
    to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that 
    power''---vindicated?\footnote{Casebook pp. 25--26.}
\end{enumerate}
