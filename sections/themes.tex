\section{Themes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sticking to strict constitutional norms versus deviations for the 
    sake of exigencies or emergencies---e.g., the Philadelphia Convention's 
    narrow mandate to revise the Articles of Confederation versus the 
    perceived need to draft a new constitution.\footnote{Cf. Casebook p. 21.}
    \item Were Hamilton and Iredells fears about the Bill of Rights---that 
    enumerating limitations on the federal government's powers ``would furnish 
    to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that 
    power''---vindicated?\footnote{Casebook pp. 25--26.}
    \item \textbf{Constitutionalism}: why does a court have the power to stop 
    ordinary democracy?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There have been only two cases where constitutional amendments 
        overruled Supreme Court decisions: Fourteenth (\emph{Dred Scott v. 
        Sandford}) and Twenty-Sixth (\emph{Oregon v. Mitchell}) Amendments.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Key areas:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Constitutionalism.
        \item Federalism.
        \item Liberty.
        \item Equality.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item How does popular legitimacy check government power?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Acts at the executive's discretion are ``only politically 
        examinable.'' \emph{Marbury}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item How does the Supreme Court's power depend on its legitimacy? How 
    does the Court respond to political pressure? What are the implications of 
    the fact that the Court relies on the other branches to enforce its 
    decisions?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius}.
        \item \emph{Bush v. Gore}.
        \item \emph{Brown v. Board of Education}.
        \item Federalist ``irreconcilables'' in the House ultimately caved and 
        cast their electoral votes for Jefferson.\footnote{Casebook p. 101.}
        \item If the Court's legitimacy depends on the other branches, is it 
        really a countermajoritarian institution?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Does the Equal Protection Clause require color blindness in all 
    situations? See the history of the Fourteenth Amendment.
    \item Did the Reconstruction amendments only end slavery, or did they 
    establish protections for broader substantive rights?
    \item What to do when the authors of the Constitution or amendments are 
    the same authors of legislation that is in question (e.g., the Judiciary 
    Act of 1789 in \emph{Marbury})?
    \item What's the point of making the Constitution supreme and not just an 
    ordinary piece of legislation?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Government is skeptical of itself, so it builds in structural 
        safeguards that cannot be changed without extraordinary effort.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What types of discrimination does the Fourteenth Amendment allow?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item At the time of its adoption: denial of suffrage to women and 
        blacks.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
