\section{Interpreting the Constitution}

\subsection{Background}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Articles of Confederation:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Submitted to the states in 1777; took effect in 1781 when the 
        last state, Maryland, assented.
        \item ``.~.~.~a treaty among a group of small nations.~.~.~''\footnote{Casebook p. 
        19.}
        \item Voluntary taxes: ``pompous petitions for 
        charity.''\footnote{Casebook p. 19.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Feb. 1787: Congress authorized a convention ``for the sole and 
    express purpose of revising the Articles of 
    Confederation'' but it led to the drafting of the new Constitution. 
    \footnote{Casebook p. 21.}
    \item Amendments to the Articles of Confederation needed the states' 
    unanimous consent, but Article VII of the Constitution only required nine 
    states' approval. Rhode Island rejected and North Carolina postponed 
    ratification. The Constitution took formal effect in June 21, 1788 when 
    the ninth state, New Hampshire, ratified. By Washington's inauguration in 
    1789, 11 states had ratified.
    \item \textbf{Necessary and Proper Clause}: ``The Congress shall have 
    Power~.~.~.~To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying 
    into Execution the foregoing powers.''\footnote{U.S. Const. art. I, \S\ 8; 
    casebook p. 4.}
    \item In Federalist 84, Hamilton responded to calls for a bill of rights: 
    ``the bill of rights~.~.~.~would afford a colourable pretext to claim more 
    [powers] than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done 
    which there is no power to do?~.~.~.~it is evident it would furnish to men 
    disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that 
    power.''\footnote{Casebook p. 25.}
    \item Anti-federalist responses to Hamilton's argument pointed out that 
    the Constitution emphasizes limitations elsewhere, e.g., the limitation on 
    granting titles of nobility.\footnote{U.S. Const. art. I, \S\ 9; casebook 
    p. 26.}
    \item 1791: states ratified ten of twelve proposed amendments.
