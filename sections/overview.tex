\section{Overview}

\subsection{Separation of Powers, Federalism, and Judicial Review}

% TODO: add dissents for all opinions

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Ware v. Hylton} (1796): the Court assumed the power to review 
    state legislation under the Supremacy Clause.
    \item \emph{Marbury v. Madison} (1803): the court held the Judiciary Act 
    of 1789 to be unconstitutional because in granting the Court original 
    jurisdiction in acts by government officials, Congress exceeded its 
    constitutional power.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Judicial review}: the Court has the final say in 
        constitutional interpretation.  ``It is emphatically the province and 
        duty of the judicial department to say what the law 
        is.''\footnote{Casebook p. 116.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Dred Scott v. Sandford} (1857): Congress cannot ban slavery in 
    the states.
    \item \emph{The Slaughter-House Cases} (1873): the Privileges and 
    Immunities Clause forbade state infringement of the rights of 
    \emph{national} citizenship, but not the rights of state citizenship. A 
    broader interpretation would ``fetter and degrade'' the 
    states.\footnote{Casebook p. 325.} The Bill of Rights does not apply to 
    the states---at least not through Privileges and Immunities.
    \item \emph{Myra v. Bradwell} (1873): the Fourteenth Amendment did not 
    transfer the power to regulate professional licenses to the federal 
    government. It remains with the states.
    \item \emph{Minor v. Happersett} (1875): citizenship does not confer 
    suffrage.  The Fourteenth Amendment did not create new privileges or 
    immunities. It 
    only furnished additional protections for existing rights.
    \item \emph{Plessy v. Ferguson} (1896): the Fourteenth Amendment abolished 
    \emph{legal} but not \emph{social} distinctions between races. ``Separate 
    but equal'' does not impose a ``badge of inferiority.''\footnote{Casebook 
    p. 361.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Justice Harlan, dissenting: ``Our Constitution is color-blind, 
        and neither knows nor tolerates classes among the 
        citizens.''\footnote{Casebook p. 363.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\emph{Lochner} and Substantive Due Process}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Lochner v. New York} (1905): New York cannot limit the number 
    of hours a baker can work because the regulation violates the Due Process 
    Clause's protection of liberty.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Lochnerism}: the Court strikes down regulation as 
        infringing on economic liberty.
        \item Problems with Lochnerism:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Is the freedom to contract a fundamental right?
            \item The \emph{Lochner}-era Court was inconsistent---e.g., 
            upholding regulations for coal miners but not for bakers.
            \item The Court substituted its own values for those of 
            legislatures.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Champion v. Ames} (1903): Congress can regulate interstate 
    mailing of lottery tickets. Congress can use its Commerce Clause powers to 
    protect commerce as well as promote public policy goals.
    \item \emph{Hammer v. Dagenhart} (1918): Congress can use its Commerce 
    Clause power only to regulate harmful activity. Lottery tickets are 
    harmful, but child labor is not.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Economic Due Process}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item After the Civil War, the Bill of Rights increasingly applied to the 
    states via the Fourteenth Amendment.
    % TODO: adkins v childrens hospital
    \item \emph{West Coast Hotel v. Parrish} (1937): minimum wage laws for 
    women are legitimate. % TODO expand
    \item \emph{United States v. Carolene Products} (1938): the Court upheld a 
    prohibition on interstate commerce in filled milk. The Court should 
    presume the constitutionality of regulation unless it does not ``rest upon 
    some \textbf{rational basis}.''\footnote{Casebook p. 515.} 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Footnote four}: the Court should apply heightened 
        scrutiny to provisions that (1) facially violate constitutional 
        provisions, (2) distorts political processes, or (3) affects discrete 
        and insular minorities.\footnote{Casebook p. 515.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Williamson v. Lee Optical} (1955): the Court upheld 
    regulations requiring licenses to do optical work. The Court will uphold 
    regulation if it can imagine a rational purpose, regardless of legislative 
    intent.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Race}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item % TODO nat'l security: chan chae ping, korematsu (strict scrutiny)
    \item [Brown, brown II] % TODO
    \item The Court developed a two-part test for identifying race-based equal 
    protection violations. First, is there a distinct class? Second, is there 
    systematic discrimination against that class? \emph{Hernandez v. Texas}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item This is similar to the rationale for \emph{Brown}, but here the 
        reasoning is explicit.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item When race is involved in any way, the Court moves from rational 
    review (``any legitimate state interest'') to strict scrutiny 
    (``compelling government interest''). \emph{Loving v. Virginia}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Loving} also struck down the last pillar of Jim 
        Crow---antimiscegenation laws---and held that racial discrimination 
        implicates both equal protection (i.e., equality) and due process 
        (i.e., liberty).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item (applying strict scrutiny to race: yick wo, etc.) % TODO
    \item Title VII prohibits employers from requiring job applicants to have 
    high school diplomas and pass a general intelligence test without showing 
    that those criteria predict job performance. \emph{Griggs v. Duke Power}.
    \item The Court declined to read the \emph{Griggs} ``disparate impact'' 
    standard into the Fourteenth Amendment. \emph{Washington v. Davis}.
    \item \emph{Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.} established 
    factors that courts can use to determine when government decisions are 
    racially motivated:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The impact of the action, including patterns that emerge.
        \item The decision's historical background.
        \item The sequence events leading up to the decision.
        \item ``Departures from the normal procedural 
        sequence.''\footnote{Casebook p. 1040.}
        \item Substantive departures from normal procedure.
        \item Legislative or administrative history.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item UC Davis's affirmative action plan was unconstitutional. However, 
    race is not categorically off limits. \emph{University of California v. 
    Bakke}. % TODO expand
    \item Race-based classifications are subject to strict scrutiny. 
    Race-based affirmative action programs must be related to a compelling 
    government interest---the same standard as programs that intentionally 
    discriminate \emph{against} racial groups. \emph{Richmond v. Croson}.
    \item The \emph{Croson} rule---that any racial classification is subject 
    to strict scrutiny---applies to Congressional actions as well as state and 
    local actions. \emph{Adarand v. Pena}.
    \item [McCleskey] % TODO
    \item [Grutter] % TODO
    \item [Gratz] % TODO
    \item Universities using point systems for admissions cannot grant 
    automatic bonuses to minority applicants because of their race. 
    \emph{Gratz v. Bollinger}.
    \item Schools cannot consider race when assigning students to schools, 
    even if racial imbalances exist between schools. \emph{Parents Involved in 
    Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Gender}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [early cases -- bradwell, adkins, reed] % TODO § 4.3.1.1
    \item Gender-based classifications require heightened scrutiny. 
    \emph{Frontiero v. Richardson}.
    \item [craig v. boren] % TODO
    \item \emph{Baker v. State}: the Vermont Supreme Court 
    held that sex-based marriage restrictions violated the state's 
    constitution by enforcing sex stereotypes without any legitimate 
    reason.\footnote{Casebook pp. 1221--22.}
    \item If a statute has a disparate impact on one gender, it is invalid 
    only if the legislature passed it \emph{because of} a desire to 
    discriminate, not merely \emph{in spite of} knowledge that a disparate 
    impact would result. \emph{Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. 
    Feeney}.
    \item Legislation that differentiates between sexes based on biological 
    factors is not necessarily discriminatory. Applying the \emph{Feeney} 
    principle, the Court held that pregnancy was not a pretext for the 
    legislature to invidiously discriminate against women. \emph{Geduldig v. 
    Aviello}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Modern Substantive Due Process}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Bill of Rights guarantees a ``penumbra'' or ``zone of privacy.'' 
    \emph{Griswold v. Connecticut}.
    \item [eisenstadt] % TODO
    \item The right to privacy does not protect the right to engage in private 
    homosexual activity. \emph{Bowers v. Hardwick}.
    \item There is no rational basis for discriminating against homosexuals 
    solely because of animosity towards homosexuality. \emph{Romer v. Evans}.
    \item States cannot prohibit private sexual activity between consenting 
    adults of the same sex. \emph{Lawrence v. Texas}
